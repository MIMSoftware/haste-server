# Haste: Short-term Storage & Sharing

Use to quickly share stacktraces, logs, screenshots.

### THIS IS NOT A REPLACEMENT FOR CORE ATTACHMENTS - DO NOT USE IT AS SUCH
### IF YOU ARE SHARING FOR NOTE/ECO INVESTIGATION THEN IT BELONGS IN CORE



## Duration

Pastes will stay for 30 days from their last view. They may be removed earlier
and without notice.

This service is intended to enable quickly sharing logs, screenshots or other 
snippets for quick resolution of support issues.

## Sharing Text

Type or paste text into the new document editor.

Syntax highlighting will attempt to auto-detect a proper style and apply when 
viewing the document.

Shortcuts are available to make creating and saving documents faster:

(Mac users can use Cmd instead of Ctrl)

* Ctrl + N: Create new document (use when on a current page like this one)
* Ctrl + S: Saves the text to a new document (use after typing/pasting on page)
* Ctrl + E: Edit the current document (this will be saved to a brand new link)
* Ctrl + D: Load raw text (useful when you want to save the document to disk)

## Sharing Files

To share screenshots or log files (or zip), simply drag the file from your 
desktop onto the page. After the upload has finished you will be redirected 
to the file's location, which you can then share.

## Issues

Report questions/issues to Christopher Speck.
